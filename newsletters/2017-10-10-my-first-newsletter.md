      No matter your reason, changing your business name can be costly,
      stressful, and time consuming; but it can also be lucrative. Way back in
      1992, Sprint was known as United Telecom; in 2008, Kinkos transformed into
      FedEx Office. These companies handled the renaming process successfully,
      and you can as well.

      Effective marketing increases donations and gets your message out there,
      but for most nonprofits, it’s difficult to spend the time making low-cost
      ideas work. But, shelling out money when, ideally, you want everything to
      go back in to your cause, also seems unrealistic. By being creative with
      your marketing efforts, you can dramatically increase funding, supporters,
      and visibility, with a net positive win for the people or cause you’re
      trying to help.

      You know that $200 doesn’t go very far in your personal life, and when it
      comes to marketing your business that monthly budget can feel like
      pennies. But with some strategic thinking and a little work, you can
      actually do a lot with it. First, focus on just one to three channels,
      targeting avenues where your customers are most likely to see the ad. In
      this case, it doesn’t pay to cast a wide net.

      Customer databases are the backbone of conversion and retention, giving
      you information that lets you tailor marketing efforts and programs to
      your actual customer base. The result? Reduced costs, increased
      effectiveness, and keeping customers engaged with your brand. These
      databases are important for service as well as product focused businesses,
      and useful if you’re a sole proprietor or have 20+ employees.

      "Like a lot of people today I was afraid to venture out. One day I got the
      courage and did it. I started with only one student, and then it grew to
      seven and before you knew it I was having endless phone calls for
      enquiries to book at Piano Made Fun"
